# Virat-Kohli-Runs-Predictor

This is a Github repository containing a linear regression model to predict the number of runs scored by the Indian cricketer Virat Kohli in a given match.

Overview
Virat Kohli is one of the most successful cricketers in the world and has a huge fan following. This project aims to predict the number of runs he is likely to score in a match based on various factors such as the venue, opposition team, batting position, etc. The model is built using linear regression, which is a simple and effective machine learning algorithm for predicting numerical values.

Dataset
The dataset used to train and test the model is taken from the official website of the International Cricket Council (ICC). It contains information about Virat Kohli's performances in various matches, including the number of runs scored, the venue, the opposition team, the batting position, and other relevant factors.

Model
The model is built using linear regression, which is a simple and effective machine learning algorithm for predicting numerical values. The features used in the model include the venue, opposition team, batting position, and other relevant factors. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and then tested on the remaining portion to evaluate its performance.

How to use
To use the model, simply clone the repository and run the virat_kohli_runs_predictor.py file. This will prompt the user to enter various inputs such as the venue, opposition team, batting position, etc. Based on these inputs, the model will predict the number of runs Virat Kohli is likely to score in the match.
